        <h2 id="headline">Here's a little info about Uncle Slow</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Slow Mobius ,voiced by Chris Romano, had the ability to slow down time.</li>
          <li>He met his demise at the hands of Rick Prime who used the Omega Device to kill him in all realities, erasing him from the infinite multiverse.
</li>
          <li>Slow Mobius was a green, pale-skinned, alien of a humanoid appearance. He was short, stout and wrinkly, with his face resembling Rick's, with the same shape mouth, an elongated nose and giant eyes, but he also had some warts on his head. He wore a cosmic suit that has a clock on the front of it. He also wore a band around his head with a clock on the front of it.</li>
          <li>Slow Mobius had a fun-loving and comedic personality, shown when he slowed down time around Morty when the latter saw Jessica at the party, continuing to do so until Rick noticed and berated him for the clich√©. He seemingly was a good husband to his wife, judging by her deep grief towards him after his passing</li>
          </ul>
<blockquote>He was an all-round O.K. guy. 6/5 would like to see him die again. </blockquote><cite>Mwenda Ng'olua</cite>
